This package contains classes for SQL types that NanoDB uses during
storage and evaluation.  Typically, NanoDB will use standard Java classes
to represent values (e.g. <code>java.lang.String</code> for <tt>CHAR</tt>
and <tt>VARCHAR</tt> types).  However, in some situations this is not
possible because the standard Java types aren't completely suitable.
