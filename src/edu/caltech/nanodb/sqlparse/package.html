This package contains all of the classes for SQL lexing and parsing in NanoDB.
At this point, all of the classes are generated by ANTLR, so don't expect these
classes to contain very much javadoc documentation.  They will contain as much
as reasonable, though.
<p>
Here are some files describing the NanoSQL <a href="doc/NanoSqlLexer.html">lexer</a>
and <a href="doc/NanoSqlParser.html">parser</a> grammars.

<b>TODO:</b> Add info about calling the lexer and parser to parse commands.
