This package contains the query-evaluation components of the database.  Query
evaluation includes the following kinds of statements:
<ul>
<li>SELECT statements</li>
<li>INSERT statements</li>
<li>UPDATE statements</li>
<li>DELETE statements</li>
</ul>
In fact, the only real difference with any of these statements is what is done
with the rows that are retrieved.
<p>
Commands that drive the evaluation components are represented as the
{@link edu.caltech.nanodb.commands.QueryCommand} class and its subclasses.  The
details of the commands being performed are filled in by the SQL parser.
