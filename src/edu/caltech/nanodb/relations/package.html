This package contains the basic data-types for representing relations in NanoDB.
Relations can be many different things - tables, views, external tables, or
results of subqueries in a particular SQL query, for example.  All of the common
classes are in this package.

<h3>Type Information</h3>

One of the major aspects of this package is the collection of classes that
represent type information in the database.  The classes are as follows:

<ul>
  <li>
    Data-types are defined by the
    {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.relations.SQLDataType} enumeration, which
    contains both the enumerated types and predefined type-ID byte-values.
  </li>
  <li>
    Column-types are defined by the
    {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.relations.ColumnType} class, which contains the
    SQL data-type for the column (using the
    {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.relations.SQLDataType} enum), and any
    additional information about the column's type that might need to be
    specified.  For example, a <code>CHAR(100)</code> column has a base-type of
    <code>SQLDataType.CHAR</code>, but it must also specify its length as 100
    characters.  This additional information is also included in the
    <code>ColumnType</code> class.
  </li>
</ul>
