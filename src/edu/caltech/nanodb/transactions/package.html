This package contains classes for managing transactions at the logical level,
such as concurrency control and isolation, deadlock detection and aborting
transactions.  Physical logging of transaction updates, actual rollback of
transaction changes, and other similar low-level details, are performed by the
{@link edu.caltech.nanodb.storage.writeahead} package.
