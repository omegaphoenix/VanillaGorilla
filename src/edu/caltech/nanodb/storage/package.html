This package contains the classes for the Storage Manager, which is responsible
for how data is stored in and retrieved from database files.
</p>

<h2>Startup Sequence</h2>

<p>
The start-up sequence for the storage layer is as follows:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>The Storage Manager is initialized first.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.storage.StorageManager#init}
                method is invoked first.</li>
            <li>The directory for NanoDB's data files is determined.</li>
            <li>The {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.storage.StorageManager}
                constructor is invoked.</li>
            <li>The {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.storage.FileManager} is
                initialized, with the appropriate data directory.</li>
            <li>The {@link edu.caltech.nanodb.storage.BufferManager} is
                initialized, wrapping the {@code FileManager}.</li>
            <li>File-managers for table-files and index-files are initialized
                at this point.  Generally they don't need to do anything at
                initialization time; it's just a convenient time to initialize
                them.</li>
        </ol>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Implementing New Tuple-File Formats</h2>

<p>
Adding new tuple-file formats to NanoDB should be reasonably straightforward,
but there are several interfaces that must all be implemented for the tuple
file to be operational inside NanoDB.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        The core implementation of the tuple-file format must be provided as
        an implementation of the {@link TupleFile} interface, or one of its
        sub-interfaces.  Depending on what the tuple-file format can provide,
        it may be appropriate to implement {@link SequentialTupleFile} for a
        format that maintains a logical ordering over all tuples, or
        {@link HashedTupleFile} for a format that supports constant-time tuple
        lookups using a subset of the tuple's columns.  If none of these
        guarantees can be provided, then the {@link TupleFile} interface is
        the correct one to implement.
    </li>
    <li>
        Certain operations on tuple files can't be provided on the
        {@link TupleFile} implementation itself, so they are provided by the
        {@link TupleFileManager} interface.
    </li>
</ul>
