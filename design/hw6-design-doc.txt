     None.

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

     David implemented navigateToLeafPage(), fixed a bug in
     splitLeafAndAddTuple(), implemented addRowToIndexes() and implemented
     removeRowFromIndexes().
     Justin implemented splitLeafAndAddTuple(), movePointersLeft(),
     and movePointersRight().
     Matthew helped debug the implementations and focused on the analysis.

B:  Analysis of Implementation
------------------------------

Given NanoDB's B+ tree implementation, consider a simple schema where an
index is built against a single integer column:

     CREATE TABLE t (
         -- An index is automatically built on the id column by NanoDB.
         id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
         value VARCHAR(20)
     );

Answer the following questions.

B1.  What is the total size of the index's search-key for the primary-key
     index, in bytes?  Break down this size into its individual components;
     be as detailed as possible.  (You don't need to go lower than the
     byte-level in your answer, but you should show what each byte is a
     part of.)

     There are 8 bytes. The actual id integer is 4 bytes, and the file
     pointer is 4 bytes (the pageNo is a unsigned 16-bit = 2 byte value and the
     offset is an unsigned 16-bit = 2 byte value).

B2.  What is the maximum number of search-keys that can be stored in leaf
     nodes of NanoDB's B+ tree implementation?  You should assume a page-
     size of 8192 bytes.

     First, we subtract 2 bytes (for the extra pointer to other leaf nodes)
     from 8192, leaving us with 8190 bytes to fit 8 byte search-keys, for 1023
     keys.

B3.  What is the maximum number of keys that can be stored in inner nodes
     of this particular implementation?  (Recall that every key must have
     a page-pointer on either side of the key.)

     The difference between inner nodes and leaf nodes is that the offset is
     not also stored. So, each key is only 6 bytes, for 8190 / 6 = 1365 keys.

B4.  In this implementation, leaf nodes do not reference the previous
     leaf, only the next leaf.  When splitting a leaf into two leaves,
     what is the maximum number of leaf nodes that must be read or written,
     in order to properly manage the next-leaf pointers?

     When splitting a leaf node, we create a new leaf node, point the old leaf
     node to the new leaf node, and point the new leaf node to where the old
     leaf node pointed. Thus, we read or write to 2 leaf nodes.

     If leaves also contained a previous-leaf pointer, what would the
     answer be instead?

     Again, we create a new leaf node, point the old leaf node to the new leaf
     node and vice versa. We point the new leaf node to where the old
     leaf node pointed, and also vice versa. Thus, we read or write to 3 leaf
     nodes, because the leaf node pointed to by the old leaf node must also be
     modified.

B5.  In this implementation, nodes do not store a page-pointer to their
     parent node.  This makes the update process somewhat complicated, as
     we must save the sequence of page-numbers we traverse as we navigate
     from root to leaf.  If a node must be split, or if entries are to be
     relocated from a node to its siblings, the node’s parent-node must
     be retrieved, and the parent’s contents must be scanned to determine
     the node’s sibling(s).

     Consider an alternate B+ tree implementation in which every node
     stores a page-pointer to the node’s parent.  In the case of splitting
     an inner node, what performance-related differences are there between
     this alternate representation and the given implementation, where
     nodes do not record their parents?  Which one would you recommend?
     Justify your answer.

     With the current method, we store in memory a path of nodes to get to
     the current node. As we traverse the tree to get to the desired node, this
     little extra computation is done. With the proposed method, the parents
     are instead stored on disk instead, but we can modify the nodes without
     first traversing the tree to find its parents. However, we recommend the
     current implementation because reading and writing to disk is
     prohibitively expensive, while the traversal has already been done to get
     to the desired node that we want to split.

B6.  It should be obvious how indexes can be used to enforce primary keys,
     but what role might they play with foreign keys?  For example, given
     this schema:

     CREATE TABLE t1 (
        id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY
     );

     CREATE TABLE t2 (
         id INTEGER REFERENCES t1;
     );

     Why might we want to build an index on t2.id?

     First of all, the foreign key constrains t2.id to be unique entries. It is
     also possible that table t2 is more sparse than table t1, so a separate
     index will be cheaper to traverse.

E:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

E<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

F:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.

F1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

F2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

F3.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

F4.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

F5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
