CS122 Assignment 5 - Advanced Subqueries - Design Document
==========================================================

A:  Logistics
-------------

A1.  List your team name and the people who worked on this assignment.

     <team name>

     <name>
     <name>
     ...

A2.  Specify the repository URL, tag name and commit-hash of the Git version
     you are submitting for your assignment.  (You can list the commit hashes
     of your repository tags with this command:  git show-ref --tags)

     Repository URL:  <url>
     Tag name:        <tag>
     Commit hash:     <hash>

A3.  Specify any late tokens you are applying to this assignment, or
     "none" if no late tokens.

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

B:  Subquery Planning
---------------------

B1.  Which planner did your team add subquery planning to?  How easy or
     difficult was it to incorporate subquery-planning into the planner?

B2.  Briefly outline the process by which you perform subquery planning in
     your query planner.  Also explain briefly how your subquery-planner works.

B3.  Briefly describe how you detect whether there are subqueries in the
     GROUP BY and ORDER BY clauses.  How do you make sure this doesn't
     interfere with subqueries in other clauses?

C:  Correlated Evaluation
-------------------------

C1.  How easy or difficult was it to incorporate support for correlated
     evaluation into your query planner?  Did it affect the sequence of
     steps in any substantial ways?

D:  Decorrelating Queries
-------------------------

D1.  Which example query decorrelation did your team choose to implement?
     Why did you choose this query?

D2.  How does your planner determine whether a query follows the pattern
     that your planner can decorrelate?  How does it identify the components
     of the query in order to decorrelate it?

D3.  Briefly outline the process by which your planner decorrelates the query.
     How does it modify the subquery, and how does it modify the enclosing
     query?

E:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

E<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

F:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.

F1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

F2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

F3.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

F4.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

F5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
