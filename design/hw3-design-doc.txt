     none

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

     Justin focused on calculating costs for NestedLoopJoin and computing
     selectivity for AND, OR, and NOT.
     Matthew focused on
     David focused on calculating costs for SimpleFilterNode and FileScanNode
     and calculating selectivity for column-value comparisons and column-column
     comparisons and analyze().

B:  Statistics Collection
-------------------------

B1.  Using pseudocode, summarize the implementation of your HeapTupleFile
     analyze() function.

C:  Plan Costing Implementation
-------------------------------

C1.  Briefly describe how you estimate the number of tuples and the cost
     of a file-scan plan node.  What factors does your cost include?

     Get the number of tuples from tableStats and apply selectivity multiplier
     if there is a predicate. The cpuCost is just the number of tuples in the
     table and the numBlockIOs is the number of data pages since we assume
     that there is one block IO for each page that needs to be read since
     each must be loaded individually.

C2.  Same question as for C1, but for simple filter nodes.

     The tuple size and number of block IOs are the same as the left child's
     since the left child loads the tuples into memory. For the CPU cost,
     we add numTuples to the child's CPU cost since we must iterate through
     each tuple and the numTuples is (selectivity * (the child's numTuples)).

C3.  Same question as for C1, but for nested-loop joins.

     For nested loop joins, the tupleSize is always the sum of the tupleSizes
     except when it is a natural join where there might be combined columns
     so we used the sum of the tupleSizes as the approximation.

     The number of tuples is determined based on join type*.

     The cpu cost is the cost of iterating through the nested loop which
     compares every element in the first table to every element of the second.

     We assume the inner table fits in memory so numBlockIOs is just the sum
     of the children's numBlockIOs.

     *The number of tuples is just the product for cross join, approximately
     the selectivity times the product for inner join since a fraction of
     those pairs will satisfy the condition. Left outer join has the number of
     tuples the inner join would have plus the number of left tuples not
     paired which we estimate as (1 - selectivity) * leftTuples.  Semijoin
     is appoximately the number of leftTuples that have a partner which we
     underestimate at (selectivity * leftTuples).  To get antijoin just
     take (1 - selectivity ) * leftTuples.

D:  Costing SQL Queries
-----------------------

Answer these questions after you have loaded the stores-28K.sql data, and
have analyzed all of the tables in that schema.

D1.  Paste the output of running:  EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM cities;
     Do not include debug lines, just the output of the command itself.

D2.  What is the estimated number of tuples that will be produced by each
     of these queries:

     SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population > 1000000;

     <paste output here>

     SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population > 5000000;

     <paste output here>

     SELECT * FROM cities WHERE population > 8000000;

     <paste output here>

     How many tuples does each query produce?

     Briefly explain the difference between the estimated number of tuples
     and the actual number of tuples for these queries.

D3.  Paste the output of running these commands:

     EXPLAIN SELECT store_id FROM stores, cities     WHERE stores.city_id = cities.city_id AND
           cities.population > 1000000;

     <paste output here>

     EXPLAIN SELECT store_id FROM stores JOIN                    (SELECT city_id FROM cities                     WHERE population > 1000000) AS big_cities                    ON stores.city_id = big_cities.city_id;

     <paste output here>

     The estimated number of tuples produced should be the same, but the
     costs should be different.  Explain why.

D4.  The assignment gives this example "slow" query:

     SELECT store_id, property_costs     FROM stores, cities, states     WHERE stores.city_id = cities.city_id AND
           cities.state_id = states.state_id AND           state_name = 'Oregon' AND property_costs > 500000;

     How long does this query take to run, in seconds?

     Include the EXPLAIN output for the above query here.

     <paste output here>

     How would you rewrite this query (e.g. using ON clauses, subqueries
     in the FROM clause, etc.) to be as optimal as possible?  Also include
     the result of EXPLAINing your query.

E:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

E<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

F:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.

F1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

F2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

F3.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

F4.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

F5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
