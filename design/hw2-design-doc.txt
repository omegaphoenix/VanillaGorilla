CS122 Assignment 2 - SQL Planning and Joins - Design Document
=============================================================

A:  Logistics
-------------

A1.  List your team name and the people who worked on this assignment.

    VanillaGorilla

    Justin Leong
    Matthew Jin
    David Qu

A2.  Specify the repository URL, tag name and commit-hash of the Git version
     you are submitting for your assignment.  (You can list the commit hashes
     of your repository tags with this command:  git show-ref --tags)

     Repository URL:  https://github.com/omegaphoenix/VanillaGorilla
     Tag name:        <tag>
     Commit hash:     <hash>

A3.  Specify any late tokens you are applying to this assignment, or
     "none" if no late tokens.

A4.  Briefly describe what parts of the assignment each teammate focused on.

B:  Simple Planner
------------------

B1.  Without going into the details of how you handle grouping and
     aggregation or joins, list the general sequence of steps that your
     planner's makePlan() method follows to translate a SQL query into
     an execution plan.

B2.  Does your planner try to simplify plans in specific circumstances,
     e.g. when a "trivial project" is used (i.e. "SELECT * FROM ...") in
     your planner?  Briefly enumerate all simplifications and optimizations
     your planner employs.

B3.  Describe how you generate the execution-plan fragment for the query's
     FromClause.  Make sure to touch on what you do in the three cases your
     planner is expected to handle - tables, subqueries in the FROM clause,
     and joins.

B4.  Describe how you implemented support for grouping and aggregation.
     Be sure to note any variations from the approach outlined in class,
     if there are any.

B5.  Describe how you implemented support for natural joins, and joins with
     a USING clause.  Focus on how you handle challenging cases, such as
     t1(a, b) NATURAL JOIN t2(a, c) NATURAL JOIN t3(a, d).

C:  Nested-Loop Join
--------------------

C1.  The join algorithm stated in class is really only suitable for
     materialized evaluation, where the entire result is generated by the
     algorithm.  It is completely unsuitable for pipelined evaluation,
     where results are generated row by row.

     Summarize how your implementation works for inner joins, using
     pseudocode to show how rows are considered and returned as the
     algorithm executes, and what state must be saved so that the
     operation can resume at the appropriate place when the next row
     must be returned.

     leftChild.init
     leftTuple = leftChild.next()
     MainLoop:
     while leftTuple is not null
         rightChild.init
         leftTuple = leftChild.next()
         while rightTuple is not null
             if pred(leftTuple, rightTuple)
                 return join(leftTuple, rightTuple)
                 rightTuple = rightChild.next()
                 GOTO MainLoop
         leftTuple = leftChild.next()
         GOTO MainLoop

    The leftTuple and rightTuple must be saved so that the algorithm can
    resume at the appropriate place when the next row must be returned.

    The leftTuple is incremented when rightTuple can't be incremented
    anymore which means there are no rows left from rightChild and we
    reset rightChild to iterate through it's tuples again.

C2.  What tweaks did you need to introduce into the implementation for
     left outer joins?  Keep your answer brief, but please also be specific.

     We just added rightTuple == null to the predicate check and kept track
     of the last leftTuple that we joined so that if we did not join the
     current leftTuple when we finish iterating through the rightChild's
     rows, then we will return a new tuple of (leftTuple, null). This
     introduces a new state we have to keep track of which we call
     prevLeftTuple.

C3.  Same question as for C2, but for semijoins.

C4.  Same question as for C2, but for antijoins.

C5.  Enumerate your nested-loop join test cases, following this form:

     * <test-case class name>.<test function>
       <brief one-sentence description of what the test exercises>

D:  Extra Credit [OPTIONAL]
---------------------------

If you implemented any extra-credit tasks for this assignment, describe
them here.  The description should be like this, with stuff in "<>" replaced.
(The value i starts at 1 and increments...)

D<i>:  <one-line description>

     <brief summary of what you did, including the specific classes that
     we should look at for your implementation>

     <brief summary of test-cases that demonstrate/exercise your extra work>

E:  Feedback [OPTIONAL]
-----------------------

WE NEED YOUR FEEDBACK!  Thoughtful and constructive input will help us to
improve future versions of the course.  These questions are OPTIONAL, and
they obviously won't affect your grade in any way (including if you hate
everything about the assignment and databases in general, or Donnie and/or
the TAs in particular).  Feel free to answer as many or as few of them as
you wish.

NOTE:  If you wish to give anonymous feedback, a similar survey will be
       made available on the Moodle.

E1.  How many hours total did your team spend on this assignment?
     (That is, the sum of each teammate's time spent on the assignment.)

E2.  What parts of the assignment were most time-consuming?  Why?

E3.  Did you find any parts of the assignment particularly instructive?
     Correspondingly, did any parts feel like unnecessary busy-work?

E4.  Did you particularly enjoy any parts of the assignment?  Were there
     any parts that you particularly disliked?

E5.  Do you have any suggestions for how future versions of the
     assignment can be improved?
